What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Answer: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on creating reusable and modular code by using concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

What is encapsulation in Java?
- Answer: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface to interact with the object. It helps in achieving data security, code reusability, and maintainability. In Java, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) and getter and setter methods.

What is inheritance in Java?
- Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class. It promotes code reusability and allows the creation of hierarchies of classes. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.

What is polymorphism in Java?
- Answer: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined within a class.

What is abstraction in Java?
- Answer: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes provide a partial implementation of a class, while interfaces define a contract of methods that implementing classes must implement.

What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
- Answer: The main difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java is that an abstract class can provide a partial implementation, including instance variables and non-abstract methods, whereas an interface only defines method signatures and constants. A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only inherit from a single abstract class.

What is method overriding in Java?
- Answer: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method signature (name, return type, and parameters) must be the same in both the superclass and the subclass. Method overriding allows a subclass to modify the behavior of a superclass method according to its own requirements.

What is method overloading in Java?
- Answer: Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined within a class. The methods must have different parameter lists (different number of parameters or different types). Java determines which method to execute based on the arguments passed during the method invocation.

What is the difference between composition and inheritance in Java?
- Answer: Composition and inheritance are two ways of achieving code reuse in Java. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from its superclass, promoting an "is-a" relationship. Composition, on the other hand, allows a class to contain other objects as member variables, promoting a "has-a" relationship. Composition offers more flexibility and modularity compared to inheritance.

What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?
- Answer: The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass of a subclass. It can be used to access the superclass's constructor, methods, or variables. It is often used in method overriding to call the superclass's version of an overridden method. Additionally, super can be used to differentiate between a superclass and subclass variable with the same name
